# 🐾 Project Title: [Insert Catchy Cat Pun Here]

## 🎮 Global Game Jam 2026 Entry
Welcome to our official repository for the **Global Game Jam 2026**! 

This year's theme was **[Insert GGJ 2026 Theme]**, and we decided the only logical way to interpret that was through the eyes of a cat. Because, let’s face it, everything is better with whiskers.

## 🐱 The Game
In this game, you play as a nimble (or perhaps slightly clumsy) cat navigating a world built on Godot 4.x. 

### Key Features:
* **Purr-fect Platforming:** Fluid movement mechanics built using Godot's `CharacterBody2D`.
* **Dynamic Meow System:** Procedural audio scaling based on how much attention you demand.
* **Chaos Engine:** A dedicated physics interaction layer specifically for knocking expensive vases off tables.
* **Greeble Vision:** Toggleable shader effects to see things that aren't actually there.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Engine:** [Godot Engine 4.x](https://godotengine.org/)
* **Language:** GDScript (and a dash of luck)
* **Assets:** Created during the 48-hour crunch using Aseprite / Blender / Inkscape.
* **Theme:** Interpreted with maximum creative liberty.
